// Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

let names : string[]=[`muhammad` , `ahmed` , `qamar` , `moriya`];
for (let name for names)

{
console.log(`Good Morning ${name}, I hope you're having a Fantastic day!`)
}
